# Compressive MultiAgent System Sensing (CMASS)

Cluster identification in multiagent systems using CMASS algorithm.

## Requirements

In case you wish to run the notebook on your machine, the following packages should be installed beforehand:
* Python 3
* NumPy
* SciPy
* matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## How to use the software

Install the required packages then import classes and functions in [cmass/](cmass/).
Inspect class and function documentation using ```help(item)``` or ```print(item.__doc__)```, where ```item``` is a class or a function.
An example of CMASS usage is demonstrated in [example_16nodes.ipynb](example_16nodes.ipynb).

### Naive example

You may test a naive example of an algorithm with simplified code.
Navigate to [naive_example/](naive_example/) and run 
```shell
jupyter notebook Cluster_Identification_In_Kuramoto_Model.ipynb
```

Otherwise you can access and run the notebook in Google Colab via [the link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gGQB3KwUvaP229AOSWqu3lanJL5VjX7m?usp=sharing).
In this case, you are not required to install the packages listed above &mdash; all calculations are performed in the remote cloud.
