# clusterFlow

A simulation environment for cluster identification in multiagent systems

## Requirements

In case you wish to run the notebook on your machine, the following packages should be installed beforehand:
* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebook
* NumPy
* SciPy
* matplotlib

## How to run

Install the required packages.
Then navigate to ./clusterFlow and run 
```shell
jupyter notebook Cluster_Identification_In_Kuramoto_Model.ipynb
```

Otherwise you can access and run the notebook in Google Colab via [the link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gGQB3KwUvaP229AOSWqu3lanJL5VjX7m?usp=sharing).
In this case, you are not required to install the packages listed above &mdash; all calculations are performed in the remote cloud.
